# FounderOfFortune

This is a small project meant to simulate Fortune's Foundation, one of the games in the [Zachtronics Solitaire Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1988540/The_Zachtronics_Solitaire_Collection/), and an attempt at building a solver for the game.

Currently, only the game engine and (some) unit tests for it exist.
